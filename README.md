# Mapping_Earthquakes
Leaflet.js with APIs - Module 13
## Purpose
Visually represent the magnitude of earthquakes around the world over the last 7 days. 

## Resources
Data from the USGS website in GeoJSON form will be used to map and show magnitude of each earthquake. Tectonic Plate formations will be used from a GitHubUserContent site.

## Approach
The main language used for this challenge is JavaScript. The D3 library will be used to read the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library will be used to map the earthquakes and tectonic plates on a Mapbox map. The map will allow users to pick different base maps and choose which overlays to view. A legend will be present to show the color codes for the different magnitude earthquakes. Each earthquake will be clickable to show the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.
